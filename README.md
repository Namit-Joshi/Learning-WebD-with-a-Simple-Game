I made a simple game using HTML CSS and JavaScript 

# GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.
- However if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'HOLD', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
